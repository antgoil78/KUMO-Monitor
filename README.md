# KUMO Monitor

## Local configuration

Runtime secrets are loaded from `.env`. This file is ignored by Git and should
stay local to each developer machine.

Use `.env.example` as the non-secret template for required variables.

## Local Docker run

After Docker is installed:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

`docker-compose.yml` automatically reads `.env` and passes the Snowflake
settings into the container at runtime. Do not pass Snowflake credentials as
Docker build args or commit them to Git.

### Snowflake account identifier

If Snowflake returns an error like:

```text
404 Not Found: post <account>.snowflakecomputing.com:443/session/v1/login-request
```

then `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` is probably not the full Snowflake account identifier
for the account's region/cloud.

Use the value shown in Snowsight under account details for connectors/drivers.
For the Python connector, use the account identifier without `https://` and
without `.snowflakecomputing.com`.

Examples:

```bash
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=myorg-myaccount
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=abc12345.west-europe.azure
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=abc12345.eu-central-1.aws
```

### MFA for local password auth

If Snowflake requires MFA for your user, set a current TOTP code before starting
the container:

```bash
SNOWFLAKE_PASSCODE=123456 docker compose up --build
```

The passcode is short-lived. Do not commit it, and do not rely on this pattern
for unattended deployments. For automated builds/deployments, prefer a
deployment-specific auth method such as Snowflake-managed service auth,
key-pair auth, OAuth, or a programmatic access token according to your Snowflake
security policy.

## Local development run

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python -m flask --app app run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the Flask backend on port `5000`.

## Development workflow

1. Code and test locally using Docker or the split backend/frontend dev servers.
2. Keep `.env` local only; commit `.env.example`, code, and docs.
3. Push the repo to Git.
4. Build and deploy the Snowflake container from the Git source.
